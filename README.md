INSTALLATION:
Place the entire folder VectorTransformation inside the directory:

C:\Users\{Your Username}\.qgis2\python\plugins\

and load the plugin from the QGIS environment:

Plugins > Installed > Vector Transformation


ABOUT:
This plugin was created during my Masters Programme at the Technological Educational Institute of Athens,
department of Surveying & Geoinformatics Engineering with the title "Geospatial Technologies" for the 
course "Programming & Geospatial Applications".

This plugin applies transformations on vector layers and saves the new geometry in a new shapefile along with the old layer attributes.
It supports layer geometry types of: Points, MultiPoits, Lines, MultiLines, Polygons and MultiPolygons.

USAGE:
1) Load Layers in QGIS
2) Run the plugin
3) Choose transformation from the list
4) Enter variables
5) Select output shapefile location (DO NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING SHAPEFILE)
6) Press OK to run the module

Transformations included in the plugin: 
1) Translation 

x' = x + Tx<br />
y' = y + Tx<br />

2) Rotation 

x' = cos(rx) * x + sin(ry) * y<br />
y' = -sin(rx) * x + cos(ry) * y<br />

3) Scale

x' = x * sx <br />
y' = y * sy 

4) Similarity

x' = cos(r) * s * x + sin(r) * s * y + Tx<br />
y' = -sin(r) * s * x + cos(r) * s * y + Ty<br />

5) Affine 

a = sx * (cos(r) + d * sin(r))<br />
b = sy * sin(r)<br />
c = sx * (-sin(r) + d * cos(r))<br />
d = sy * cos(r)<br />

x' = a * x + b * y + Tx<br />
y' = c * x + d * y + Ty<br />

6) Affine (with known coefficients)

x' = a1 * x + b1 * y + c1<br />
y' = a2 * x + b2 * y + c2<br />

7) Projective

x' = (a1 * x + b1 * y + c1) / (a0 * x + b0 * y + 1)<br />
y' = (a2 * x + b2 * y + c2) / (a0 * x + b0 * y + 1)<br />

where:
x',y' are the new and <br />
x,y are the input coordinates<br />
Tx, Ty are the axis translation parameters<br />
sx, sy are the axis scale parameters and <br />
s the global scale parameter<br />
rx, ry are the axis rotation parameters and<br />
r the global rotation parameter<br />
delta is the axis perpenticularity parameter<br />
